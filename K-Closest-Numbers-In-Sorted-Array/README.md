Given a target number, a non-negative integer k and an integer array A sorted in ascending order, find the k closest numbers to target in A, sorted in ascending order by the difference between the number and target. Otherwise, sorted in ascending order by number if the difference is same.

Given A = [1, 2, 3], target = 2 and k = 3, return [2, 1, 3].

Given A = [1, 4, 6, 8], target = 3 and k = 3, return [4, 1, 6].
