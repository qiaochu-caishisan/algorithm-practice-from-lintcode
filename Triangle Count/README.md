Given an array of integers, how many three numbers can be found in the array, so that we can build an triangle whose three edges length is the three numbers that we find?

Example
Given array S = [3,4,6,7], return 3. They are:

[3,4,6]
[3,6,7]
[4,6,7]
Given array S = [4,4,4,4], return 4. They are:

[4(1),4(2),4(3)]
[4(1),4(2),4(4)]
[4(1),4(3),4(4)]
[4(2),4(3),4(4)]
本题采用二分法 用特殊的方法有效避免了很多问题 就是每次只从选定点往前找边  是道好题
