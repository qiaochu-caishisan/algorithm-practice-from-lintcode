Given n pieces of wood with length L[i] (integer array).
Cut them into small pieces to guarantee you could have equal or more than k pieces with the same length. 
What is the longest length you can get from the n pieces of wood? Given L & k, 
return the maximum length of the small pieces.

For L=[232, 124, 456], k=7, return 114.
