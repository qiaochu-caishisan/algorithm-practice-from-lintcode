Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

Example
Given board =

[
  "ABCE",
  "SFCS",
  "ADEE"
]
word = "ABCCED", -> returns true,
word = "SEE", -> returns true,
word = "ABCB", -> returns false.

BFS PLUS DFS版本 真的是有点坑爹 差点做不出来 感觉太麻烦了 估计对word建树就会很快搞定
